A comprehensive back-end as well as front-end solution for creating a football league database that stores and updates relevant information as the tournament progresses. 
This includes generating automatic fixtures, updating scorelines and updating the points table as every match is completed.
The database also stores some static data regarding the teams, stadiums, players and coaches.

Creation of schema and insertion of static data is done just once at the start of the season. The dynamic data can then be updated regularly through the website.

<b>Tools and Framework :</b> SQL Server and Flask
